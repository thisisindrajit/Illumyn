# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive Learning Experience Generator is an AI-powered application designed to transform educational content into engaging, interactive learning experiences. The system can process various inputs (topics or research papers) and generate personalized learning content with interactive elements such as quizzes, polls, and reordering exercises. The application aims to make learning more engaging, effective, and tailored to individual preferences.

2. WHEN the user proceeds to generate content THEN the system SHALL prompt for depth/breadth focus preference.
3. WHEN generating a course THEN the system SHALL prompt for additional preferences including difficulty level and prior knowledge assumptions.
4. WHEN the user provides preferences THEN the system SHALL store these preferences for the current session.
5. WHEN the user has previously used the application THEN the system SHALL offer to use saved preferences from previous sessions.

### Requirement 4: AI Content Generation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want the system to generate high-quality educational content based on my inputs and preferences, so that I can learn effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all required inputs and preferences are provided THEN the system SHALL generate educational content using AI.
2. WHEN generating content from a topic THEN the system SHALL research and compile relevant, accurate information on the topic.
3. WHEN generating content from a research paper THEN the system SHALL extract and summarize key information from the paper.
4. WHEN generating a course THEN the system SHALL create a structured curriculum with multiple interconnected blocks.
5. WHEN generating a block THEN the system SHALL create a focused learning unit on a specific aspect of the topic.
6. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL include appropriate citations and references for information sources.
7. WHEN the generation process is ongoing THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator.
8. IF the generation process takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion time.

### Requirement 5: Block Structure and Widget System

**User Story:** As a learner, I want content blocks to be composed of various widgets and interactive elements, so that I can engage with diverse content formats in a single learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a block THEN the system SHALL create a collection of widgets and interactive exercises interspersed with each other.
2. WHEN generating a block THEN the system SHALL include multiple widget types (text, image, video embed, code, etc.).
3. WHEN generating a block THEN the system SHALL include at least 3 different types of interactive elements.
4. WHEN generating widgets THEN the system SHALL adapt content complexity based on user preferences (focus, difficulty, prior knowledge).
5. WHEN focus preference is set to "breadth" THEN the system SHALL generate widgets with broader, more introductory content.
6. WHEN focus preference is set to "depth" THEN the system SHALL generate widgets with more detailed, specialized content.
7. WHEN difficulty preference is set to "beginner" THEN the system SHALL generate simpler content with more explanations.
8. WHEN prior knowledge is set to "advanced" THEN the system SHALL generate more sophisticated content with fewer basic explanations.
9. WHEN creating interactive elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback mechanisms.
10. WHEN a user completes an interactive element THEN the system SHALL track and display progress.

### Requirement 6: Content Presentation and Navigation

**User Story:** As a learner, I want a clean, intuitive interface to navigate through the generated learning content, so that I can focus on learning without usability barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content generation is complete THEN the system SHALL present the content in a clean, readable format.
2. WHEN viewing a course THEN the system SHALL provide a table of contents or navigation menu.
3. WHEN viewing a course THEN the system SHALL allow navigation between blocks.
4. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL support responsive design for different device sizes.
5. WHEN viewing content THEN the system SHALL provide accessibility features compliant with WCAG guidelines.
6. WHEN viewing content with interactive elements THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish interactive elements from static content.
7. WHEN navigating through content THEN the system SHALL save progress automatically.

### Requirement 7: Content Saving and Sharing

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to save, export, or share my generated learning experiences, so that I can access them later or distribute them to others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing generated content THEN the system SHALL provide options to save the content to a user account.
2. WHEN viewing generated content THEN the system SHALL provide options to export content in common formats (PDF, HTML).
