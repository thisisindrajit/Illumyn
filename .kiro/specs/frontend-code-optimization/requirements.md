# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Frontend Code Optimization project aims to improve the existing Next.js frontend codebase by standardizing CSS styling patterns, removing unnecessary code, and ensuring consistent code quality across all components. The project focuses on making the codebase more maintainable, performant, and following best practices for modern React/Next.js development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CSS Styling Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent CSS styling patterns throughout the codebase, so that the code is easier to maintain and understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing spacing utilities THEN the system SHALL use either `gap` or `space` consistently across all components, not mixing both approaches
2. WHEN reviewing layout utilities THEN the system SHALL use consistent Tailwind CSS class patterns for similar layout needs
3. WHEN reviewing component styling THEN the system SHALL ensure all components follow the same spacing, sizing, and layout conventions
4. WHEN reviewing responsive design THEN the system SHALL use consistent breakpoint and responsive utility patterns
5. WHEN reviewing color and theme utilities THEN the system SHALL use consistent color and theme class patterns across components

### Requirement 2: Code Cleanup and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unnecessary code removed from the frontend, so that the codebase is lean and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL remove all unused import statements
2. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL remove unused variables, functions, and props
3. WHEN analyzing CSS classes THEN the system SHALL remove unused or redundant Tailwind CSS classes
4. WHEN analyzing component logic THEN the system SHALL remove dead code and unused conditional branches
5. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused dependencies from package.json
6. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL remove empty or placeholder files that serve no purpose

### Requirement 3: Component Structure Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want components to follow consistent structure and patterns, so that the codebase is predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component files THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent import ordering (React, third-party, local imports)
2. WHEN reviewing component structure THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent prop destructuring patterns
3. WHEN reviewing component exports THEN the system SHALL use consistent export patterns (default vs named exports)
4. WHEN reviewing component organization THEN the system SHALL ensure related components are properly grouped
5. WHEN reviewing TypeScript usage THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent type definitions and interfaces

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend code to be optimized for performance, so that the application loads faster and runs smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing component rendering THEN the system SHALL identify and optimize unnecessary re-renders
2. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL implement proper code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
3. WHEN analyzing images and assets THEN the system SHALL ensure proper optimization and loading strategies
4. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN the system SHALL identify and address large bundle contributors
5. WHEN analyzing runtime performance THEN the system SHALL optimize expensive operations and computations

### Requirement 5: Code Quality and Best Practices

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend code to follow modern React and Next.js best practices, so that the codebase is robust and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing React patterns THEN the system SHALL ensure proper use of hooks and component lifecycle
2. WHEN reviewing Next.js patterns THEN the system SHALL ensure proper use of App Router, server components, and client components
3. WHEN reviewing accessibility THEN the system SHALL ensure components meet WCAG accessibility standards
4. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the system SHALL ensure proper error boundaries and error handling patterns
5. WHEN reviewing security THEN the system SHALL ensure no security vulnerabilities in component implementations
6. WHEN reviewing testing THEN the system SHALL ensure components are testable and follow testing best practices

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend code to be well-documented and maintainable, so that future development is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing component props THEN the system SHALL ensure proper TypeScript interfaces and JSDoc comments where needed
2. WHEN reviewing complex logic THEN the system SHALL ensure adequate inline comments explaining business logic
3. WHEN reviewing component structure THEN the system SHALL ensure components have clear, descriptive names
4. WHEN reviewing file organization THEN the system SHALL ensure logical file and folder structure
5. WHEN reviewing reusable code THEN the system SHALL ensure proper abstraction and component reusability
