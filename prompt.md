I want to create an AI powered app that can convert any topic or any file (restricting to research papers for now) into interactive learning experiences. By interactive learning experiences, what I mean is that given a topic or file and some preferences (short/long duration, depth/breadth focus), it can generate a personalised course with interactive exercises like quizzes, reorder, poll etc. or block (a block is just a single page of content with interactive exercises like quizzes, reorder, poll etc.). If a file is inputted, then only a block can be generated and not a course. If its just a topic like say "Quantum Mechanics", the user can choose between generating personalised course or block.

Plan the whole app and write down all tasks

---

Rewrite the code in Java as I will be using springboot as the backend, keep the code simple as much as possible while adhering to SOLID principles. 



My main tech stack is this: 

React/TypeScript for the frontend

SpringBoot for the backend

Postgres for the database



Also create an ERD diagram with the entities
